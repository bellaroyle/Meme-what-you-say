## About

Meme what you say is a real-time multi-player iOS app that challenges players to come up with the best captions for popular memes.

The app was created for as final project for my software development course at Northcoders. This was a group project. The other members of the team are James Collins, Rachel Caruso-Bryant and Tom Hogg.

## How to Play

- Fork the repo and clone it to your computer.
- Open the project in your code editor.
- Run the command `npm install` in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies.
- Run the command `expo start` which will produce a QR code for you and your friends to scan. (Note: you may have to change the connection from LAN to Tunnel before sharing the code.)
- Play the game! (Game Rules are available on the home page.)
- When you have had enough, run `control c` in the terminal to stop the app running.
